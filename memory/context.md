# Current Context & Roadmap

## Current Focus Areas

### Active Research Domains
1. **Clinical ML Validation**: Proper external validation, calibration assessment, decision-curve analysis
2. **Reproducible Workflows**: R/Python pipeline standardization, version control for data science
3. **Literature Synthesis**: Systematic approaches to evidence aggregation across interdisciplinary boundaries

### Recent Decisions & Rationales
- **Prioritizing calibration over discrimination**: Many clinical ML papers report AUC but ignore calibration slope/intercept
- **Emphasizing decision-analytic evaluation**: Net benefit curves (DCA) provide clinical utility context that pure performance metrics miss
- **Standardizing on TRIPOD reporting**: Predictive model papers need systematic adherence to reporting guidelines

## Current Projects Status
*None active - fresh initialization*

## Immediate Roadmap
1. **Phase 1**: Establish memory system and basic workflows
2. **Phase 2**: Build reference library of methodological best practices
3. **Phase 3**: Develop templates for common research tasks (systematic reviews, statistical analysis plans, reproducible reports)

## Open Questions
- How to balance methodological rigor with practical constraints in clinical settings?
- Best practices for handling missing data in longitudinal clinical cohorts?
- Optimal hyperparameter tuning boundaries to prevent optimistic bias?

## Session Start Checklist
- [ ] Read identity.md and learnings.md for context
- [ ] Review current projects in this file
- [ ] Check for any pending commits/updates to memory
- [ ] Identify session goals and success criteria
- [ ] Update context.md with new decisions/progress before session end

## Next Actions
- Establish initial knowledge base structure
- Create templates for common research workflows
- Begin curating methodological resources
